# DrawLoop

DrawLoop is a hybrid sound & drawing application for the browser built with p5.js. Users interact with a set of “tools”, that create visuals and audio simultaneously, by drawing with the mouse.The compositions can be shared and viewed in a gallery, which will serve to demonstrate the multitude of ways people respond to an unfamiliar process.



## Instructions 
Click to select a draw tool in the "toolbox" section. A tool has to be selected in order to draw.
Draw something on the canvas with your mouse.
When you release the mouse, a module will pop into the "tools" section. You can modify or delete your sound drawing here.
The drawings are sound loops that are synced, in other words, they will automatically be time with each other.  
Press "save" to create a 30 second recording, and download a snapshot of your loop.
That's it! Have fun
